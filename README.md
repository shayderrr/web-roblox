# web-roblox
roblox for the web

## how it works
fork this repo [  ]

rip a fake roblox clone game (i recommend either yandex or twoplayergames) but any works [  ]

make all assets link via jsdelivr (split files over 20mb) [  ]

put the SINGLEFILE aka the DOWNLOABLE and runnable file on your repo [  ]

open a pull request and ill accept it [  ]

then ur thing will be on our site [  ]
